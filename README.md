# covid-response-OC
To help the local community with covid-19. Data provided by [OC Public Health Care Agency](https://www.ochealthinfo.com/phs/about/epidasmt/epi/dip/prevention/novel_coronavirus).  

## Getting Started

* Clone this repo.  
* Make sure you have NPM, and run `npm install`.
* There is a node file to scrape data from the OC Public Health website, that's currently manually run with `node assets/js/scrapper.js`.  I then copy and paste the data into `assets/js/data.js`.  It's a messy process, but a quick and dirty solution for having no back end, with much room for improvement.


## Built With
